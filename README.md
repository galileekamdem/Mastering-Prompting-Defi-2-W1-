#  Mastering Prompting – Educloud Academy Challenge (Week 1 – Task 2)

This repository is part of the **“Cloud & AI Builders” 30-Day Challenge** organized by **Educloud Academy**.

##  Project Title: Prompt Engineering vs Context Engineering

In this project, I created a PartyRock web app that explains and compares two essential skills when working with LLMs:

- 🛠️ **Prompt Engineering**  
- 🌐 **Context Engineering**

The site also includes clear examples of:
- ✅ **Zero-shot prompting**
- ✅ **One-shot prompting**
- ✅ **Two-shot prompting**

## 📘 Topics Covered

###  Prompt Engineering
The art of crafting effective, specific prompts to guide an AI model toward better results.

###  Context Engineering
The process of embedding additional information (roles, tone, examples, background knowledge) into the prompt to guide the AI’s behavior.

### 💡 Prompting Techniques

| Technique | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| Zero-shot | No examples provided | “Translate this to Spanish: Hello.” |
| One-shot | One example included | “Hello = Hola. Now: Good night = ?” |
| Two-shot | Two examples given | “Dog = Perro, Cat = Gato. Bird = ?” |
